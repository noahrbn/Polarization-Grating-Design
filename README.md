# Polarization-Grating-Design
Design code and examples for polarization-analyzing metasurface diffraction gratings as in N.A. Rubin et al., "Matrix Fourier optics enables a compact full-Stokes polarization camera", *Science* **365** (6448) aax1839, 2019 [[1]](#1). That paper can be found [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax1839). See that paper and especially its supplement for extensive detail on the methods used here.

This repository contains everything needed to design and analyze a polarization-analyzing grating as described in that work. Please refer to the included Jupyter notebook `Designing a metasurface polarization grating.ipynb` for instructions and an example of how this works.

For any questions, please submit an issue or contact me at noahrubin [at] ucsd.edu or noah.rbn [at] gmail.com.
